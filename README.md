# tischool
This repository contains every program that I wrote for my calculator back in grade school. A few of my friends helped out on some of them and you will see their credits in the respective projects they made. Most of these programs are suppossed to help automate workflow of Math and Science classes, helping make "Plug and Chug" style equations truly just dropping in variables and making more complex methods easier to understand and navigate. There are also some for fun programs tucked in here too! All of these funcitons were built on a TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition. They have all been tested and work on traditional non-color TI-84 Plus models. Compatibility should work with other MATHPRINT compatible caluclators but not guaraunteed. 

## Structure
TI BASIC programs are stored as .8xp files. If you know TI BAISC well understood and edited, and can be edited easily with things like [SourceCoder](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/). However, it can be difficult at a glance to understand what is going on, so I have provided plain text versions of all of the files. 

A directory exists for each of my different programs, each directory has two subdirectories, one for the 8xp files and one for the plain text versions. Some of these are borken up into multiple files and may not be self explanatory. Information on the contents of each and how to use them are stored in this document.
